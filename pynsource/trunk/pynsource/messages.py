HELP_MSG = """
PyNSource Gui Help:

Import a python file and it will be reverse engineered and represented as UML.

Import multiple files by multiple selecting files (hold ctrl and/or shift) in the file open dialog.
You can import repeatedly and incoming classes will be added and wired up to existing classes on the workspace.

Layout is a bit dodgy so arrange your layout a little and then do a screen grab (using your favourite screen grabbing tool) or print.
You cannot add new classes in the GUI, this is just a reverse engineering tool.  You can however delete uncessesary classes by right clicking on the node.
