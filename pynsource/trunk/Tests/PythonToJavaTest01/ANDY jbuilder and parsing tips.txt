Consider some folder e.g. .../Tests/ and create a jbuilder project based off there called PythonToJavaTest01 which will actually create a folder called PythonToJavaTest01 plus subfolders called src and classes etc.  The Borland project file will also live in .../Tests/PythonToJavaTest01/ with a name PythonToJavaTest01.jpx

Run pynsource so that it dumps the output into the src folder

e.g. assuming the batch file is in the PythonToJavaTest01 folder and the python source is in 
    .../Tests/PythonToJavaTest01/pythoninput01
then the command is
    pynsource -j src pythoninput01\*.py
