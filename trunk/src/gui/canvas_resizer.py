Notes:

Purpose of shrinkage_leeway
---------------------------
Relax the compacting rule so that canvas virtual size may be shrinkage_leeway%
bigger than the "all shapes bounds" without it being trimmed/compacted down. The
purpose of this is to relax the rules and not have it so strict - after all it
doesn't hurt to have a slightly larger workspace - better than a trim workspace
jumping/flickering around all the time. Plus if you manually drag resize the
frame it will trim perfectly.

How canvas virtual size stretches
---------------------------------
As you resize the canvas size / frame, the canvas virtual size stays the same as
what you set it to using SetScrollbars() - up until the point at which the
scrollbars exhaust themselves and disappear - which means the that you have
finally made frame == virtualsize. After which point virtual size auto-grows as
the frame continues to grow. If you shrink the frame again, then virtualsize
will reduce until it hits the old original value of virtualsize set by
SetScrollbars(). If you continue to reduce the frame then the scrollbars appear,
but the virtualsize remains the same.

When bounds become dirty
-------------------------
After a programmatic change of "all shapes bounds" e.g. via stateofthenation
or when move a node via the mouse

"all shapes bounds" area doesn't change when resizing a frame, thus the
bounds is not dirty
        
Repeated calls from frame resize event
--------------------------------------
Note: repeated calls from frame resize event shouldn't be a problem because
current "all shapes bounds" == self.allshapes_bounds_last due to our
recording of allshapes_bounds_last every time it is set by us. If nothing has
changed then we don't do anything. Thus repeated hammering from resize event is
protected against.

Additionally we cache the calls to calc_allshapes_bounds in
self.allshapes_bounds_cached to avoid constant recalc. Typically the first
resize event might cause the SetScrollbars() call and then subsequent calls do
nothing.

Also since shrinkage_leeway is 0 when called from a frame resize event, if the
virtual canvas is any bigger than the bounds of the shapes - even 1% bigger -
then trim the virtual canvas. Normally the tolerance for shrinking has a leeway
of 20-40% or so.
