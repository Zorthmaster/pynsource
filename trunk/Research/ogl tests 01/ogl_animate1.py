            that you have to calculate the bounding area of old location.

            Note somewin.Refresh() is a call deep into wx itself. Not a method
            on shapecanvas but on wx.window itself. Marks the specified
            rectangle (or the whole window) as "dirty" so it will be repainted.
            Causes an EVT_PAINT event to be generated and sent to the window.
            !!!! doesn't this then potentially trigger an OnPaint and a redraw
            of the whole window anyway? Anyway, try commenting Refresh() out and
            see what happends - smearing!
            
            Also if after the move/refresh combo you don't hit the main message
            loop soon enough, then you will see one animation frame worth of smearing
            hence use wx.SafeYield() depending on where all this is being called from.
