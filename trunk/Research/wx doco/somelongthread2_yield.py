# LongRunningTasks - second example - yield

"""
The second approach, using wxYield, should be fine too - just add a call to
wxYield() somewhere within the computation code such that it executes
periodically. At that point, any pending window events will be dispatched
(permitting the window to refresh, process button presses, etc...). Then, it's
similar to the above in that you set a flag so that when the original code gets
control after the wxYield() returns it knows to stop processing.

As with the threading case, since all events go through during the wxYield() you
need to protect against trying to run the same operation twice.

Here's the equivalent of the above but placing the computation right inside the
main window class. Note that one difference is that unlike with threading, the
responsiveness of your GUI is now directly related to how frequently you call
wxYield, so you may have delays refreshing your window dependent on that
frequency. You should notice that this is a bit more sluggish with its frequency
of a wxYield() each second.
